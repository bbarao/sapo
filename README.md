# sapo

These are the lost software source files from the beginning of SAPO in the mid 90s, when buffer overflows, peer reviewing, continuous integration and self respect were not that important. Slightly tweaked to compile in a modern system, but mostly intact, enough to provide a few laughs to friends at the cost of my own humiliation.

## compiling

If you want to compile this software, then you need:

```
brew install fcgi
brew install tinycdb
```
